Remedy is a simple application whose concept is to remind users to take the medicine that has been inputted and then be able to follow the medication consumption schedule in a disciplined and regular manner. The benefit of this application is that it makes it easier for someone to take medicine regularly if many prescriptions from doctors have been given or the person often consumes and mixes their own medicine so that it is consumed according to schedule. In addition, the target user group for this application is the elderly, but it does not rule out the possibility that teenagers or others are the target users of this Remedy application. This application provides several prominent features, including:

- Drug Input: Users can add drugs they want to consume based on general doses or doctor's prescriptions.
- Drug Consumption Tracking: This feature allows users to monitor their daily drug consumption patterns.
- Consumption History: Users can view the history of drug consumption that they have used for future reference or when communicating with medical personnel.

With Remedy, users can organize and manage their medication schedule efficiently so as not to miss the dose that has been set.
